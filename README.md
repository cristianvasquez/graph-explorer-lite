[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/graph-explorer.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graph-explorer)
![CI status](https://github.com/zazuko/graph-explorer/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

Do you work with graph-based data and find it difficult to understand the underlying model?

Is your graph growing rapidly and you are looking for an exploratory tool to better understand how your knowledge graph is linked?

Are you looking for a way to document your schema, ontology or data for others?

Then Graph Explorer is the tool for you!

Graph Explorer is a JavaScript-based application and library that helps you visualize, navigate, and explore RDF-based knowledge graphs and data sources. It can be configured to work with one or more SPARQL endpoints, and it can load RDF resources from the web.

In short, Graph Explorer helps you, your team, and the world better access and understand linked data.

Graph Explorer is a fork of [Ontodia](https://github.com/metaphacts/ontodia), which is now part of [Metaphacts](https://metaphacts.com/). In an effort to further develop its open-source version, we decided to fork, maintain and extend the codebase where needed. Contributions from any partners are very welcome!
